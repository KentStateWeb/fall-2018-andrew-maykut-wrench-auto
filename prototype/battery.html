            <h1>BATTERIES</h1>
            <hr />
            <p class="radp">Your car battery may be small, but the power it provides is huge. When your battery is dead, your car is dead (until you replace the battery or give it a charge). You may know that your car battery provides the jolt of electricity required to power all of the car’s electrical components, but it actually does so much more! That little tiny box performs two essential functions:</p>
            <ul class="battlist">
              <li><b>The battery gets your car going:</b> The battery delivers voltage to the starter by converting chemical energy into electrical energy. This gives your car the power it needs to start.</li>
              <li><b>The battery keeps things going:</b> The battery delivers just the right amount of energy to kick things off under the hood, but it also provides a steady stream of voltage (energy) to keep your engine running throughout your drive.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h4>What are some factors that contribute to the life of your battery?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Batteries have an estimated life of up to seven years , depending on the type of driving that you do.</li>
              <li>Recharging your battery is as simple as driving your car. While quick jaunts don’t always do provide the time your car needs to recharge, a longer drive will help your car to recharge.</li>
              <li>Extremely hot or cold weather can also cause your battery to be less effective and wear out faster than other climates.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Nothing is worse than being late for work with a dead battery, but you can save the hassle with proper maintenance.</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The average life of today’s car battery is 3 to 5 years.</li>
              <li>The two most common variables that determine your battery’s life are extreme temperature and short run times.  Cold weather can diminish your battery’s cranking power, while stop-and-go driving lessens your battery’s reserve power.</li>
              <li>Get the most out of your battery by keeping it maintained.  It’s best to have your battery tested at least twice a year and to make sure the terminals are free of corrosion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are concerned about your car starting because of a battery issue, stop in today to have one of our auto repair technicians evaluate the charge on your battery. If you do need a new battery, we can quickly install a new one and get you back on the road.</p>
